# Macro Slowdown

Exploring the connection between workforce growth, population growth, economic growth and industry. 

Land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Those are the four pillars of economic growth. While economic crises come and go, the underlying inputs remain the same. With this study, we're going to explore how population colors the economic picture. We attempt to understand its ebbs and flows, how that affected our economic past, and what it tells us about our economic future. 

*Land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. The ingredients of our economic stew.*

### Population Growth

The increase in US population has more than doubled since 1950, albeit with some decades greatly exceeding the growth of others. This story is a mix of two factors, natural increase (births exceeding deaths) and immigration. First, lets look at the the yearly growth rates since 1950.

As we can see, growth rates tend to be higher on the left side of the chart, i.e the 1950s and 1960s. There's a notable uptick in growth rates in the beginning of the 1990's but this is followed by a return to the general downward trend. 

Next, lets look at how the growth rate compares to the US fertility rate, which is simply a measure of how many children an American woman can expect to have in her lifetime.

We can see that the high growth rates of the 1950's and early/mid 1960's are closely mirrored by high fertility rates during this time. While there is a modest rebound in fertility rates from 1983 to 2007 (1.80 to 2.12), the major source of growth during this period (especially the 1990's) comes from immigration. 

Of course, people have kids or immigrate because they believe they can support that child. So let's look at the population growth rates vs economic growth rates

Given the nature of economic cycles, this above chart is a little difficult to read, so let's see the above chart but with trendlines for both growth rates.

As we can see above, as economic growth has declined, so has population growth. The extent to which this is a causal loop is unknown, and there are many factors causing both, but there is undoubtedly a connection between the two.

# Macro Slowdown

Exploring the connection between workforce growth, population growth, economic growth and industry. 

Land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Those are the four pillars of economic growth. While economic crises come and go, the underlying inputs remain the same. With this study, we're going to explore how population colors the economic picture. We attempt to understand its ebbs and flows, how that affected our economic past, and what it tells us about our economic future. 

*Land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Our four ingredients to the economic stew.*

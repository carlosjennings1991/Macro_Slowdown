# Macro Slowdown

Exploring the connection between workforce growth, population growth, economic growth and industry. 

Land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Those are the four pillars of economic growth. While economic crises come and go, the underlying inputs remain the same. With this study, we're going to explore how population colors the economic picture. We attempt to understand its ebbs and flows, how that affected our economic past, and what it tells us about our economic future. 

*Land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Our four ingredients to the economic stew.*

### Population Growth

The increase in US population has more than doubled since 1950, albeit with some decades greatly exceeding the growth of others. This story is a mix of two factors, natural increase (births exceeding deaths) and immigration. First, lets look at the the yearly growth rates since 1950.

As we can see, growth rates tend to be higher on the left side of the chart, i.e the 1950s and 1960s. There's a notable uptick in growth rates in the beginning of the 1990's but this is followed by a return to the general downward trend. 

Next, lets look at how the growth rate compares to the US fertility rate, which is simply a measure of how many children an American woman can expect to have in her lifetime.
